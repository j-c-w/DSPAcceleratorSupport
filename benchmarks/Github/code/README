This is the github evaluation set for FACC.
You should run nix-shell in the base directory of the repository to get the various tools needed for this.

clone.sh clones the repositories, and uses the local extraction scripts to extract the right regions of code to put these into the approrpriate files.
It then runs a makefile in each folder, which builds these into the executables
that FACC needs to run.
Typemaps etc. are already specified.
